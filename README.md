# Learn Web Development

Level up beyond just learning the basics of web development to becoming a successful full-stack developer by completing all the tasks in the project and making it functional.

## Project Details

This is a MERN-based project. It has some tasks to do in the existing project. Every task aims to add a feature or fix a bug. By the end of it, when you complete all the projects, you will have a solid understanding of the MERN stack. This project involves a contact form that uses React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## Purpose of the Project

I am a self-taught web developer. When I moved on from watching tutorials to actually building projects, I discovered many things that were not taught in the tutorials I watched. I got stuck in them for a long time. Through this project, I aim to share all the learnings I had in the process and help you learn it in a gamified way.

## Current State

It currently contains a lot of errors. Your aim is to fix all those!

## Aim of the Project

When the user fills the contact form, the user inputs should go to the backend and eventually get stored in the MongoDB database.

## Tasks

1. Create a .env file and store your mongo_url in it.
2. Write a start field in the package.json so that `npm start` works.
3. Set EJS type module in package.json as 'require' is used instead of import in the code.
4. Configure gitignore such that rough.txt is not pushed when `git push` is run.
5. Learn about CORS on your own and fix the CORS bug in the index.js file.
6. Check in the frontend that the user email is valid.
7. remove all warnings from the console.
8. Write a unit test to see if the invalid email is caught up or not.
9. Write a blog on Hashnode sharing all your learnings and tag SheSharp there.(optional)

## Steps

1. Fork the repo and create a branch with your name.
2. Install all the dependencies and test locally.
3. In that branch, complete all tasks one by one. After each task, commit the code.
4. Test the project locally to see if all tasks are done correctly and the contact form is functional or not.
5. Push to your forked repo and create a pull request.
6. Pat yourself on the back for the hard work!
